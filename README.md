My name is Felix Baker, but I go by Neoskimmer or Neo for short. (If you know me really well, I'm Neo The Great.)
I create open source solutions to problems I have with life.

## About Me:

I'm an Australian developer part of [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/), the world's largest open-source community of teenagers working together to create projects. I never actually get a chance to finish anything because of school and extra-ciricular activities but when I do finish stuff, it's usually pretty good :))

My current project: [High Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com) I'm writing a short program in TI-BASIC to find the day of the week from any given day.

My previous project: Cottn: A Web Based Messaging Client to get around my school blocking Discord


### Stuff I like:
  
The colour yellow 🟨

Ping Pong/Table Tennis 🏓

Rocket League and Minecraft 🏐

The Spider-verse movies 🕸️🕷️

Books (Romance and Crime Fiction) 📖

Firefox 🔥🦊

### Primary languages:

Scratch (But it's modded to the point where it's barely Scratch anymore)

TI-BASIC (Programming language for the Texas Instruments graphing calculators)

HTML (Kinda)

Python (Kinda)
