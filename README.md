# Hey there!

Thanks for showing up!
There's a bunch of stuff you should know about me, and another bunch of stuff that I just want you to know.
You can decide whether it's important or not :)))
I'm also gonna update this weekly, kinda like a blog. The about me thing is gonna stay the same tho.

## About me

My name is Felix, but online I go by the name Neoskimmer or Neo for short.
I do a lot of coding, and I only use scratch. This is because there's nothing wrong with scratch and if there was something wrong, it could be fixed with Turbowarp or PenguinMod.
My scratch profiles are listed in the sidebar :)))

Other than that, I read and write a lot (No computer pun intended).
Top 5 faviourite books:
1. Literally anything written by Alice Oseman (https://aliceoseman.com/)
2. Keeper of The Lost Cities #2 by Shannon Messenger (https://shannonmessenger.com/)
3. I don't actually know, because there's so many books I've read

I also like to watch baseball matches and study Sabermetrics. Anything Sabermetric related thing I do will probably be on https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11MkyH52ynSLTozkqAH7Jq7ewY3u68etbKWXgWPc57Ak/edit?usp=sharing
I also FREAKING LOVE learning stuff, except for new programming languages. There's probably other stuff that I hate learning about that I've forgotten about.
I'm a massive fan of Shakespeare, and anything England related.
Also, I forgot to mention video games!
I love anything Nintendo related, including the old consoles (I have a Wii, 3DSXL, Wii U, but no Switch.)
My faviourite game to play is Mariokart, particularly Mariokart Wii.

There's nothing really else to know about me. I am such a simple person.

## Blog thingo
It's kinda stupid to make an actual blog on github, so I'm just gonna list 10 things that happened in the past week.
1. I got a 89% on my maths test, which is kinda sad because I was aiming for a 94%, but it's still pretty good.
2. I found A BUNCH of stuff that I had been looking for for AGES, including my thumbdrive and my sanity.
3. I made the website https://homepagestar.w3spaces.com/ The point of it is to look nicer than the firefox homepage, while still fitting in with the theme (Purple Night)
4. I found the login to my old scratch account and finally found the email that could get my main account unbanned (It got banned for a joke that I made about my password lol)
5. I finished "I was born for this" by Alice Oseman and it was really good :0
6. The MLB team I go for (Detroit Tigers) tied a series against the Boston Red Sox
7. My school updated their absolutely crap uniform policy to an ok uniform policy
8. I lost my SD card :(((
9. I submitted my history presentation on time (Yay!!!)
10. Duck

## Other stuff

This part is for stuff that I wanna share with people, but doesn't fit in the other 2 headings. 
There's nothing here at the moment, but there will be in the future.
