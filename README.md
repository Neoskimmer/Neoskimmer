# Hey there!

Thanks for showing up!
There's a bunch of stuff you should know about me, and another bunch of stuff that I just want you to know.
You can decide whether it's important or not :)))
I'm also gonna update this weekly, kinda like a blog. The about me thing is gonna stay the same tho.

## About me

My name is Felix, but online I go by the name Neoskimmer or Neo for short.
I do a lot of coding, and I only use scratch. This is because there's nothing wrong with scratch and if there was something wrong, it could be fixed with Turbowarp or PenguinMod.
My scratch profiles are listed in the sidebar :)))

Other than that, I read and write a lot (No computer pun intended).
Top 5 faviourite books:
1. Literally anything written by Alice Oseman (https://aliceoseman.com/)
2. Keeper of The Lost Cities #2 by Shannon Messenger (https://shannonmessenger.com/)
3. I don't actually know, because there's so many books I've read

I also like to watch baseball matches and study Sabermetrics. Anything Sabermetric related thing I do will probably be on https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11MkyH52ynSLTozkqAH7Jq7ewY3u68etbKWXgWPc57Ak/edit?usp=sharing
I also FREAKING LOVE learning stuff, except for new programming languages. There's probably other stuff that I hate learning about that I've forgotten about.
I'm a massive fan of Shakespeare, and anything England related.
Also, I forgot to mention video games!
I love anything Nintendo related, including the old consoles (I have a Wii, 3DSXL, Wii U, but no Switch.)
My faviourite game to play is Mariokart, particularly Mariokart Wii.

There's nothing really else to know about me.
