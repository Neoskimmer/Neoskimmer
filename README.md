# ðŸ˜Ž Hi there!

My name is Felix Baker, but I go by Neoskimmer or Neo for short. (If you know me really well, I'm Neo The Great.)
I create open source solutions to problems I have with life.

## About Me:

I'm an Australian programmer part of [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/), the world's largest open-source community of teenagers working together to create projects.
## Cool tools I use daily:

### Firefox - The best open-source browser that's secure and fast

### Visual Studio Code - The best code editor with themes and version control
